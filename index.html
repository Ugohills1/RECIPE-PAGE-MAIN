                <li>Pepper, to taste
                <li>1 tablespoon of butter or oil

            <ol>
                <li>Beat the eggs: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed.
                    You
                    can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.
                <li>Heat the pan: Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.
                <li>Cook the omelette: Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure
                    the
                    eggs evenly coat the surface.
                <li>Add fillings (optional): When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the
                    middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.
                <li>Fold and serve: As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the
                    fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.
                <li>Enjoy: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.
